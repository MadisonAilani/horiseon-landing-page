First homework assignment; mini-project

# <Horiseon-Website>
## Description
I built this project in order to improve upon the format of the Horiseon landing page. What I did makes the webpage more accessible and makes the code slightly easier to read. While doing this, I learned how to include quotation marks inside of a tag and when and how to include alt attributes.

In order to improve accessibility, I first made sure that the nav bar had working links. Since one of them was not working initially, I added an id tag. I then added alt attributes to all of the icons and images in html. I did not include an alt attribute for the image that is added via css because it is a background image. I then made sure that all of the html code was readable, and made sure that the header tags were in sequential order. Finally, I changed the page title to "Horiseon Webpage" in order to make sure that it was as descriptive as possible.
